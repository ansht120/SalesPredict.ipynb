- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🔧 Steps Performed
1. Loaded the dataset using Pandas
2. Cleaned missing values and duplicates
3. Performed EDA with visualizations
4. Encoded categorical columns
5. Selected features and target variable
6. Trained Random Forest Regressor
7. Evaluated using MAE, MSE, R²
8. Predicted car selling prices

## 📈 Outcome
Random Forest Regressor achieved good accuracy and produced reliable price predictions.

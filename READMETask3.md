# OIBSIP_DataScience_Task3 – Email Spam Detection

## 📌 Objective
The objective of this task is to build a machine learning model that can classify emails as **Spam** or **Not Spam** using text processing and classification algorithms.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn (CountVectorizer, Train-Test Split, Naive Bayes / Logistic Regression)

## 🔧 Steps Performed
1. Loaded email dataset (CSV file)
2. Performed data cleaning and removed null/duplicate entries
3. Processed text using CountVectorizer
4. Split data into training and testing sets
5. Trained Machine Learning classifier models
6. Compared model accuracy
7. Predicted whether emails are spam or not spam

## 📈 Outcome
The model—using Multinomial Naive Bayes—achieved high accuracy in classifying emails as **Spam** or **Not Spam**, making it effective for real-time detection.

## ▶️ How to Run the Project
1. Install required Python libraries  
2. Open the `.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab  
3. Run all cells to generate output  
4. Upload your own email text to test spam detection  

## 📁 Files Included
- Dataset (CSV)
- Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb
